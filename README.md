# TPUQuest Remaster

Remaster of the game [TPUQuest](https://github.com/Kazemir/TPUQuest) on Godot. University project to make simple platformer. The original game was developed using the HaxePunk engine as a coursework project for the “Software Development” course during my studies at Tomsk Polytechnic University. It is a prototype of a simple platformer.

You can play it on [itch.io](https://chetverikov.itch.io/tpuquest-remaster)!
